# Homelab â€“ VMs and Containers

This repository tracks the base installation and configuration of all VMs and containers used in my homelab.

Each entry includes:
- Purpose of the VM or container
- OS used and basic specs
- One or two screenshots (boot screen, terminal, desktop)
- A link to the full project repository (if applicable)

This repo serves as a visual and technical index of all infrastructure components.
